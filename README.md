# DELTOID

Project deltoid is a current rework of an old Delta printer I have that is based on the kossel architechture

Main goals are :
- High speed (500mm/s minimum sustained)
- Reliability/low maintenance (200hrs service intervals minimum)
- Remote operation (OTN updates and control)
- High quality and exotic material options
- Toolhead interchangeability in the future may be an option
